r"""Machine-wide concurrency governor for headless loop runs.

SHARED FILE - this must stay BYTE-IDENTICAL across the Legion Wallpaper, Riot
Commander and Resin Compute repos. The three loops coordinate with each other
THROUGH this file's on-disk protocol, so a divergence is not a merge conflict
you notice, it is a silent concurrency bug. Nothing here may reference ANY of
them: every project-specific value arrives as an argument.

WHY A GOVERNOR AT ALL. Once the executor stops being the AHK GUI bridge (a
machine-wide singleton keyed on a window title), two loops CAN run at once - so
the things they still share need bounding. Slots bound total concurrent executor
calls on the box: the Anthropic account is one rate-limit pool, and a runaway
fan-out from two repos degrades both.

PROTOCOL. A token bucket of exclusive-create lockfiles in a shared directory.
  acquire: O_CREAT|O_EXCL on slots/<i>.lock for i in range(max_slots); first
           success wins. The file carries {pid, repo, run_id, cycle, ts}.
  reap:    a lock whose ts is older than stale_after OR whose pid is not alive
           is reclaimed. FAIL-OPEN by design - a crashed holder must never
           deadlock the other repo, so a stale lock is reclaimed rather than
           respected forever.
  release: unlink, always, in a finally.
  wait:    jittered backoff so two loops do not lockstep into each other.

HELD ONLY AROUND THE EXECUTOR CALL, never around git or the adjudicator, so a
long merge in one repo cannot starve the other.

r"""Named-mutex wrapper for the two genuinely exclusive machine-wide resources.

SHARED FILE - must stay BYTE-IDENTICAL between the Legion Wallpaper and Riot
Commander repos. The two loops coordinate through the OS namespace these names
live in, so a divergence is a silent concurrency bug. Nothing here may reference
either repo.

WHAT NEEDS SERIALIZING, and why slots are not enough. Slots bound how many
executor calls run at once; these bound access to resources where even two is
one too many:

  GEMINI_MUTEX - one metered Gemini account. Two concurrent director calls burn
    quota in parallel and can trip RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED, which the adjudicator's
    failover logic would then misread as genuine credit exhaustion and stickily
    swap the backend for the REST OF THE RUN. Serializing is cheap: director
    calls are seconds.

  GPU_MUTEX - one GPU. Acquired by the TOOL that touches CUDA rather than by the
    loop, so a manual run is protected too.

ABANDONED MUTEX. If a holder dies without releasing, Windows hands the next
waiter WAIT_ABANDONED. That is treated as ACQUIRED, with a warning: the previous
holder's work may be half-done, but refusing to proceed would let one crashed
process deadlock the other repo indefinitely.

On non-Windows this degrades to a no-op context manager so the module imports
and unit-tests cleanly in CI - but it LOGS the same UNSERIALIZED marker as the
Windows fail-open branches. Otherwise a POSIX CI run passes every serialization
test vacuously and leaves no trace of it in the log the judge reads.
